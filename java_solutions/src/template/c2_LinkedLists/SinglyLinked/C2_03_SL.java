 * Chapter 2 - Linked List
 * Problem: 2.3 Delete Middle Node:
 *
 * <p>
 * Question:
 * Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node,
 * not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node
 * <p>
 *
 * Param:
 * The single node to remove
 *
 * Example:
 * Given: The node "2" of the linked list [1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4]
 * Return: Nothing but the list should look like [1 -> 3 -> 4]
