/**
 * Chapter 2 - Linked List
 * Problem: 2.4 Partition:
 *
 * <p>
 * Question:
 *  Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes
 *  greater than or equal to x. lf x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements
 *  less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need
 *  to appear between the left and right partitions
 * <p>
 *
 * Param:
 * The head of the linked list and the partition integer
 *
 * Example:
 * Given: Partition = 5 and the linked list [3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 - > 10 -> 2 -> 1]
 * Return: Nothing but the list should look like [3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8]
